# Transit Tracker API

This is an API that is intended to be used to power a live arrivals or departures board, like [this one](https://github.com/EastsideUrbanism/transit-countdown-clock). Given a source transit feed, it will provide a WebSocket-based API that can be used to subscribe to schedule data for specific routes and stops. It can support multiple feeds at once.

## Installation

The service is distributed as a Docker image that runs on port 3000 by default. You can learn how to deploy it with the [Docker deployment guide](./deploy-docker.md).

To easily deploy a hosted instance of the API, check out the [Fly.io deployment guide](./deploy-fly.md).

### Feed Configuration

After installation, you will need to set up a feeds configuration. This will tell the API where to fetch the transit data from. These providers are currently supported:

- [GTFS / GTFS-realtime](https://gtfs.org/documentation/overview/)
- [OneBusAway](https://developer.onebusaway.org/)
- [HAFAS](https://github.com/public-transport/hafas-client) (⚠️ experimental ⚠️)

Most transit agencies will support GTFS. [Transitland](https://www.transit.land/operators) keeps an index of all known GTFS/GTFS-rt feeds, so you can use that to find the feed URL for yours.

> [!NOTE]  
> Not all parts of the GTFS specification are supported. For example, [`frequencies.txt`](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#frequenciestxt) is not supported, so if your transit agency uses it you will see incorrect or missing trips. PRs are welcome to add support for more GTFS features.

You can create a `feeds.yaml` in the working directory, or provide it as a `FEEDS_CONFIG` environment variable. A [JSON Schema](./feed-schema.json) is available. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
feeds:
  st:
    name: Puget Sound Region
    description: All transit agencies in the Puget Sound region
    # You can optionally override the service area polygon for a feed.
    # By default this is determined by the locations of the feed's stops.
    # It's advisable to set for OneBusAway-based feeds since OneBusAway can only
    # return up to 250 stops at a time and does not support pagination, so the
    # service area can potentially be incomplete.
    serviceArea: [[[-122.97713,47.071983],[-123.01475,48.535065],[-122.9441,48.59793],[-121.633194,48.26319],[-121.60341,48.255344],[-121.6016,48.25484],[-121.60102,48.251865],[-121.601,48.25134],[-121.6923,47.85279],[-121.78612,47.491642],[-121.98235,47.199947],[-122.57929,46.933628],[-122.58955,46.93304],[-122.91552,46.979607],[-122.931404,46.98552],[-122.97713,47.071983]]]

      # If your transit agency doesn't support GTFS-rt, you can omit this section
      rtTripUpdates:
        url: https://api.goswift.ly/real-time/nctd/gtfs-rt-trip-updates
        headers:
          Authorization: your_swiftly_api_key
```

### GTFS Database Setup

> [!NOTE]  
> This setup is only required if one of your feeds is a GTFS feed. If you are only using OneBusAway feeds, you can skip it.

To facilitate fast queries of the static GTFS data, the API uses a PostgreSQL database to store and index it.

Run the following command to perform the migrations on your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Replace your DATABASE_URL below
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/gtfs?sslmode=disable" pnpm gtfs:db:migrate
```

## Usage

The REST API is described with an OpenAPI specification at `/openapi`.

There is also a WebSocket interface that can be used to subscribe to real-time schedule updates. Connect to the API at its base URL and send a message with the following structure:

```json
{
  "event": "schedule:subscribe",
  "data": {
    "routeStopPairs": "st:1_100113,st:1_71971;st:1_102704,st:1_71971",
    "limit": 3
  }
}
```

The following parameters are available to tweak the schedule data:

- `limit`: The maximum number of trips to return in a single update.
- `sortByDeparture`: Sort trips by departure time rather than arrival time. This is useful for routes with long dwell times at stops.
- `listMode`: If `sequential`, then all trips across all routes will be returned in order of arrival or departure time. If `nextPerRoute`, then only the next trip for each route will be returned.

Once subscribed, you will receive updates to your desired schedule in the following format:

```json
{
  "event": "schedule",
  "data": {
    "trips": [
      {
        "tripId": "1_681754457",
        "stopId": "1_71971",
        "routeId": "1_100113",
        "routeName": "221",
        "stopName": "NE Redmond Way & Bear Creek Pkwy",
        "headsign": "Eastgate P&R",
        "arrivalTime": 1737346216,
        "departureTime": 1737346216,
        "isRealtime": true
      },
      {
        "tripId": "1_464093197",
        "stopId": "1_71971",
        "routeId": "1_102704",
        "routeName": "250",
        "stopName": "NE Redmond Way & Bear Creek Pkwy",
        "headsign": "Bellevue Transit Center",
        "arrivalTime": 1737346424,
        "departureTime": 1737346424,
        "isRealtime": true
      },
      {
        "tripId": "1_464093207",
        "stopId": "1_71971",
        "routeId": "1_102704",
        "routeName": "250",
        "stopName": "NE Redmond Way & Bear Creek Pkwy",
        "headsign": "Bellevue Transit Center",
        "arrivalTime": 1737347652,
        "departureTime": 1737347652,
        "isRealtime": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
